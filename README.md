# AI/ML Math Foundation Streamlit App

This project demonstrates a strong mathematical foundation for AI/ML with **practical applications** using the `Salary_dataset.csv` dataset. 

## Purpose
- Understand the math behind ML algorithms.
- Apply linear algebra, calculus, probability, and optimization directly in ML models.
- Visualize data and model behavior in real-time using Streamlit.

## Topics Covered
1. **Linear Algebra** – vectors, matrices, eigenvalues, PCA.
2. **Calculus** – derivatives, gradients, chain rule, Taylor expansions.
3. **Probability & Statistics** – distributions, Bayes’ rule, MLE.
4. **Optimization** – gradient descent, regularization, convex vs non-convex.

## Run the App
1. Clone the repository.
2. Install dependencies:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
